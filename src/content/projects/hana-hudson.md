The website is custom built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). We opted not to use a CMS but build the website statically as it primarily consisted of only two pages, the homepage and a single project for now.

The build includes interesting explorations of using sliders and the buttons to match the aesthetic and philosophy of the work highlighted in the project.
