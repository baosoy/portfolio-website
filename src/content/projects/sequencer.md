With the growth in VR headsets and immersive worlds, I was curious to explore if there was a possibility to connect the real-world environment to a game.

## Monitoring Air Quality

Utilising an [Enviro Urban](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-urban?variant=40056508219475) to monitor the indoor air quality, the game's mechanics update in accordance to it. However, whilst these metrics were updated every two minutes, the variance in the figures over such a short time was minimal.

Therefore, an additional API was utilised to include the ability to change your location to see how the game's mechanics would change depending on the average readings of different cities across the globe.

## Gaming Mechanics

This was a first foray into understanding gaming mechanics and exploring economic models in games. Inspired by [Decision Problem's Paperclips Game](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html), the idea was to use the basic models of the economy as the game's mechanics.
