The website was built using [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com).

## Building Blocks

The backend utilises a building-block nature of components to allow students and teachers to create pages of their work in a personalised manner. They can upload images, write text, and add links. The pages can also be saved as drafts and published when ready.

## Playfulness

The large buttons, rounded edges and shadows, and disappearing text are playful elements to the website that provide a strong consistent branding alongside the students' work.
