The website was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), statically built as it was unlikely that content would need to change often.

With gradients as a key part of the branding, there was a desire to bring these elements into the website. We utilised GLSL shaders in order to be able to do this. This same shader was utilised across the website, with changes in the colours to represent the different sections.
